# A Week In the Life of a Scrum Team

## Facilitator's Guide

### Purpose & Summary

The purposes of this activity are twofold:

- To illustrate for participants a few of the many real challenges that Scrum Masters face;
- And to help participants understand how the Manifesto for Agile Software Development can inform solutions to those common business problems.

This is done by presenting participants with problem-circumstances for which they discuss possible solutions and theorize the outcomes of their chosen solution.

This activity has been conducted for 6 groups in under 60 minutes and for 4 and 5 groups within 50 minutes.

Contact [David Sabine](//davesabine.com) for additional information and related materials.

### Required Materials

- 4 to 10 Note cards &amp; 1 marker
- 4 to 10 Pencils or pens
- 4 to 10 Sheets of paper

### Instructions

1. Divide the whole group of participants into between 4 and 10 sub-groups.  The best outcomes have occurred with 4 or 5 groups of 4 or 5 people.
2. Explain to the room the following:

   > "15 minutes from now, we're going to hear a story of a Scrum Team and the problems they encounter throughout a Sprint.  I will provide each group with a problem to solve.  Your task will be, within your group, to:
   > - consider the problem and its potential impact on the Scrum Team
   > - refer to the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and discuss which values and principles may inform a solution to the problem
   > - then write a brief story, a paragraph or two, about what the team decides to do about it.  This snippet will be like a single chapter of the larger story.
   > You'll have 7 minutes for this.  At that time, we'll all hear each group share their problem and how their Scrum Team will respond to address that problem.

3. Then Provide each group with a note card, on which is written a scenario, a problem, for their consideration.  The following 4 are recommended as a minimum:

   On this day: Sprint Planning; A team member is missing, at home sick

   On this day: Sprint Review; A key stakeholder can't attend

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; Another team, working on the same product, have just made a change which causes us unforeseen rework

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; Team is waiting on approval of a document from the legal department

   On this day: Retrospective; An Ops manager shows up and wants to participate

   On this day: Retrospective; A few team members get into a heated discussion about a defect – and they debate about which tool led to the problem

4. If more than 4 groups, then other scenarios can be added.  Consider the following or improvise:

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; Team is told that an architectural decision made in their previous Sprint doesn't "comply" with company standard

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; 2 team members are late for the Daily Scrum (it's not the 1st time)

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; Product Owner asks the team to add an "important" Product Backlog item to the Sprint

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; a team member points out that the Burndown Chart has flat-lined for a 3rd day in a row

   On this day: Mid-Sprint; a team member worked all weekend (alone) on a feature which was started by a pair

5. Set a timer for 7 minutes and encourage the groups to start discussing/writing.  The goal is to have something written that can can be shared with the room.  That reminder will help them focus on writing.  (Some groups tend to talk about the problem for 5-6 minutes before any writing occurs.  This is not a problem for most groups but they are likely to improvise portions of the story while sharing with the whole room.  Among groups who begin writing sooner, the results are often a more concise story.)

6. After 15-minutes, ask the groups to share their stories out loud.  The sequence is important:
  1. Start with the group that had "Sprint Planning"
  2. Follow with any groups that have "Mid-Sprint"
  3. End with the two groups that have "Sprint Review" and "Retrospective"

7. Between each group, or after all have read out loud, host brief QnA so that other groups can inquire about detail or discuss possible outcomes/consequences.

### Impressions

Experience shows that groups will often tell stories of their *current* workplace, not of *Scrum* workplaces.  For example, all groups (so far) who have written about the problem, "team is waiting on a document from the legal department" choose some combination of the following:

- Mark the item as "blocked"
- Pick up another item from the Sprint Backlog
- Some groups say "tell the Product Owner"
- Have the Scrum Master coordinate approval of the the document (as though a Scrum Master is like a Project Manager)

This activity presents opportunities then to offer alternative ways to address the problem circumstance.  Such as:

- Inform all stakeholders that all work of the team is paused until legal department responds
- Immediately make a request of the appropriate authorities that a representative from the "legal department" be made available to the team for the remainder of their Sprint
- Or various other strategies to dissolve the impediment
